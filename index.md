# Workshop Description

This workshop will introduce common practical use cases where natural language processing (NLP) models are applied using the latest advances in deep learning (e.g. Transformer-based models such as BERT). In this hands-on session, we will be coding in Python and using commonly used libraries such as Keras. The topics that we will cover include:

- machine translation
- sentiment extraction
- named entity recognition
