# Workshop Description

Are you curious about how computers can understand and generate human language? Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a rapidly growing field that makes this possible. From virtual assistants to language translation, NLP is behind some of the most exciting technological breakthroughs of our time.

In this workshop, you'll be introduced to the fundamental concepts of NLP and use Python programming to apply these techniques to text data. Join us for a high-content learning experience that includes stimulating lectures, group coding exercises, and even “homework” between the two workshop sessions to strengthen your newfound NLP skills.

Our primary goal is for attendees to develop a critical understanding of the power (and the limitations) of NLP, and to be able to identify opportunities to apply NLP to their own work. Specifically, attendees will:
- Understand the basic concepts of today’s key tools in NLP, such as tokenization, the concept of attention, transformers and how they are trained.
- Be able to use NLP tools and libraries, such as Keras and Hugging Face.
- Get hands-on experience applying NLP to real-world tasks such as text machine translation and sentiment extraction.
