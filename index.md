# Workshop Description

This workshop will introduce common practical use cases where natural language processing (NLP) models are applied using the latest advances in deep learning (e.g. Transformer-based models such as BERT). In this hands-on session, we will be coding in Python and using commonly used libraries such as Keras. The topics that we will cover include:

- machine translation
- sentiment extraction
- named entity recognition

## About the Instructors

![amidi](/assets/img/profile.jpg){:style="max-width:50%;"}

**Afshine Amidi** is currently working on solving NLP problems at Google. He also teaches the Data Science Tools class to graduate students at MIT. Previously, he worked in applied machine learning for recommender systems at Uber Eats where he focused on building ranking models that improve the quality of the overall search results by taking into account several objective functions. Also, Afshine published a few papers at the intersection of Deep Learning and computational biology. He holds a Bachelor’s and a Master’s Degree from École Centrale Paris and a Master’s Degree from MIT.

**Shervine Amidi** is currently working on problems at the intersection of ranking and natural language processing at Google. Previously, he worked in applied machine learning for recommender systems at Uber Eats where he focused on representation learning to better surface dish recommendations. Also, Shervine published a few papers at the intersection of deep learning and computational biology. He holds a Bachelor’s and a Master’s Degree from École Centrale Paris and a Master’s Degree from Stanford University.
